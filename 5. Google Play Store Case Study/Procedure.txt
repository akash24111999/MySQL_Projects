1. At first my file (googleplaystore.csv) was full of impurities as it was not getting imported into mysql workbench completely.
2. To tackle this I performed Data Cleaning using Python Pandas.
3. Removed the null values and the unnnamed columns.
4. Updated the 'Last_Updated' column by changing the datatype of column to standard datetime '%Y-%m-%d'.
5. Cleaning the unncessary symbols (+ and , ) to normal space and changing the datatype to int of 'Installs' column.
6. Cleaning the 'Reviews' column and changing the datatype to int.
7. Cleaning the unncessary symbols ($ ) to normal space and changing the datatype to int of 'Price' column.
8. Now saved the csv as 'play_store.csv'.
9. Now that my data is again not getting imported completely because of encoding.
10. To tackle this I first trucated the whole table. Now I need to import the data to this empty table using external file using "infile statement" (used in tranasactional statements in mysql server). But it is bydefault disabled.
11. To enable it go to C drive --> ProgramData --> MySQL --> MySQL Server 8.0 --> open the my file in notepad (before opeing the file in notepad go to services and pause the MySQL 8.0)
 --> 
Go to CLIENT SECTION --> 
# default-character-set=
local_infile=ON 
-->
Go to SERVER SECTION --> 
# server_type=3
[mysqld]
local_infile=ON
-->
press ctrl + f and search "secure"
and remove the file path for secure-file-priv="" 
-->
Save the file.
***Note***:- The file won't get saved you need to goto security under properties of the my file and change the pc user to write under edit option.
--> Save the file and restart the pc.
--> To load the file use infile statement now.
The code (Use it in local drive space only):-
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/Users/USER-PC/Desktop/Akash Cloudy ML/6. SQL/SQL Projects/5. Google Play Store/play_store.csv'
INTO TABLE googleplaystore.play_store
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
